Developer Skill API connects to a real PostgreSQL database and what each configuration step accomplished

Think of PostgreSQL as a big Excel sheet that lives on the computer but for developers and apps.
So far:
- Installed the database server (sudo apt install postgresql)
- Started it running (sudo service postgresql start)
- Verified it’s active (sudo service postgresql status)
✅ That means the computer is now running a real database server on port 5432.

Inside PostgreSQL, a database is like a specific Excel workbook.
The Spring Boot app connects to this one.
Ran:
    CREATE DATABASE developers;

- That means your app now has a private place to store tables like:
    - developer (developer info)
    - skills
    - certifications

Created a Database User (postgres)
This is like giving the app a login account to access the database.
- The app can now "log in" using a username and password to read and write data.

PostgreSQL only trusts certain kinds of logins.
That means PostgreSQL now requires a password (instead of checking the system username).
✅ This is safer and necessary for Spring Boot to connect.

Spring Boot connects to your PostgreSQL database and automatically creates tables for your Developer model.

| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Installed PostgreSQL	    |    Added a real database to the app                         |
| Created developers DB	    |    Where all developer info lives                            |
| Gave app credentials	    |    Allowed Spring Boot to connect securely                   |     
| Fixed authentication	    |    Switched from “trust local user” to “password login”      |
| Connected backend	        |    Now the app actually writes & reads real data            |
| UI shows data	            |    You’re seeing live DB content rendered in the browser     |

When you click 'Add Developer' on the UI, the data flows through all these layers.
